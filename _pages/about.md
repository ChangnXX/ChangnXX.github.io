I was born in 1993. My hometown is Jilin, a city on northeast China. 
I acquired my BS on probability and statistics on Yuanpei College, Peking University, 2015. 
I acquired my MS on probability and stochastic process on Courant Institute of Mathematical Science, New York University, 2017. 
I went back to China in 2018. 
Now I'm working on the field of machine learning, specifically, reinforcement learning and others.
